# rust-ml-algo
This is collection of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented in Rust Language.

The goal of this work:
1. Understand deeply some ML algorithms
2. Practice in Rust

For today here are:

1. Clusterization:
    1. Agglomerative clusterization
    2. DBSCAN
    3. EM (Gaussian Mixture)
    4. K-Means
    5. Mean Shift

2. Classification
    1. Decision tree
    2. Random forest
    3. Naive Bayes

3. Regression
    1. Decision tree
    2. Random forest
    3. LinearRegression


Here is also [rust-ml-algo-cases](https://github.com/dmitryikh/rust-ml-algo-cases) where benchmark tests based on real or well known datasets are written.
